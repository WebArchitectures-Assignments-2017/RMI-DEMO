# RMI-DEMO
Java Rmi

# Introduction:

This assignment consist in a simple Java Rmi (Remote method invocation) application.
Java Rmi applications refers to distributed applications in which it is made possible communication
between remote objects, through the invocation of methods between the objects themselves. In
particular for this project we were asked to implement two classes “ Document” and “server” which
has to act respectively as client and server.
The custom class Document must be able to keep a set of strings in a “Document” instance and to
print them.
The server class instead contain a remote method “addTimestamp” that, taking as parameter a
Document type, will concatenate the string “Viewed on < current-timestamp>” at the end of the
“Document” instance.
Despite these requirements the main topic of the assignment was to create a server and a client
which implements some basic remote methods using Java Rmi.
